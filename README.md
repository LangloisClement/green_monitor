# green_monitor

An old Arduino project done in High School, please be indulgent that was one of my fisrt project ^^
Carefull the code and library are not up to date (cf the version number at the start of the code)
Carefull too, it's made to be run on an arduino MEGA both for the extra pins and memory size

A huge thank to Alice Aubry and Marc-Alexis Magand my coworkers on that one.
